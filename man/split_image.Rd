\title{Split and Process an Image}
\usage{
split_image(
  image_path,
  direction = c("horizontal", "vertical"),
  output_dir = "."
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_path}{A string specifying the path to the input image file. The file must be
in a format supported by the \code{magick} package (e.g., JPG, PNG).}

\item{direction}{A string indicating the direction of the split. Must be one of
\code{"horizontal"} or \code{"vertical"}. Default is \code{"horizontal"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"horizontal"}: Splits the image into upper and lower halves. The lower half
is mirrored vertically.
\item \code{"vertical"}: Splits the image into left and right halves. The left half is
mirrored horizontally.
}}

\item{output_dir}{A string specifying the directory where the resulting images will
be saved. Defaults to the current working directory (\code{"."}).}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It saves the processed image halves
to the specified output directory and prints their paths as messages.
}
\description{
This function splits a given image into two halves either horizontally or vertically,
processes the halves by optionally mirroring them, and saves the resulting images
with appropriate names.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item For a \code{"horizontal"} split, the upper half is saved as \code{"<original_name>_upper_half.<ext>"}
and the lower half (mirrored vertically) is saved as \code{"<original_name>_lower_half.<ext>"}.
\item For a \code{"vertical"} split, the left half (mirrored horizontally) is saved as
\code{"<original_name>_left_half.<ext>"} and the right half is saved as
\code{"<original_name>_right_half.<ext>"}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Split an image vertically and save to the current directory
split_image("example.jpg", direction = "vertical", output_dir = ".")

# Split an image horizontally and save to a specific directory
split_image("example.jpg", direction = "horizontal", output_dir = "output_images")
