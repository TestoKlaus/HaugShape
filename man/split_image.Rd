\title{Split and Process an Image}
\usage{
split_image(
  image_path,
  direction = c("horizontal", "vertical"),
  split_position = 0.5,
  output_dir = "."
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_path}{A string specifying the path to the input image file. The file must be
in a format supported by the \code{magick} package (e.g., JPG, PNG).}

\item{direction}{A string indicating the direction of the split. Must be one of
\code{"horizontal"} or \code{"vertical"}. Default is \code{"horizontal"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"horizontal"}: Splits the image into two parts along a horizontal line.
\item \code{"vertical"}: Splits the image into two parts along a vertical line.
}}

\item{split_position}{A numeric value between \code{0} and \code{1}, indicating the
relative position of the split. Default is \code{0.5} (split at the midpoint).}

\item{output_dir}{A string specifying the directory where the resulting images will
be saved. Defaults to the current working directory (\code{"."}).}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It saves the processed image halves
to the specified output directory and prints their paths as messages.
}
\description{
This function splits a given image at a user-specified position, either horizontally or vertically,
processes the halves by optionally mirroring them, and saves the resulting images with appropriate names.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item For a \code{"horizontal"} split, the split occurs at \code{split_position * height}.
\item For a \code{"vertical"} split, the split occurs at \code{split_position * width}.
\item The function saves the resulting halves with filenames indicating their relative positions.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Split an image vertically at 30\% of the width
split_image("example.jpg", direction = "vertical", split_position = 0.3, output_dir = ".")

# Split an image horizontally at 75\% of the height
split_image("example.jpg", direction = "horizontal", split_position = 0.75, output_dir = "output_images")
}
